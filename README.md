# ROOT utilities

## Enhancements for ROOT

These are a collection of configuration files and custom classes that
I use to improve my day-to-day use of the <a target="_blank"
href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/">ROOT</a> data analysis
package. Having everything on Git allows versioned updates and easy
portability to all the machines that I use in my work.
